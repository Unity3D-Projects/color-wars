The reason you decided not to go with just Stopping the coroutine on state
change switch is that it assumes that all states can just be stopped where they
are with no cleanup. This is not the case. For example, stopping normal player
movement, you actually need to set the rigidbody's speed to zero. Furthermore,
on the end of a dash, what do you do? AttemptToEnterNormalState? Then Dash knows
about the states, etc. I think it would be best to register callback.
